Description:  Button at the bottom handles camera. Once you get an image, click on the marker to look at the image up close. Use the close button to make the image disappear. If you have difficulty seeing multiple images, I added a title for each that displays what number photo it is for the current session. Hopefully that helps you see that there are definitely photos being added.

Note: Worked with Easton Tuttle

Anything that doesn't work: Not that I am aware of. I am sure you are aware, but you need to zoom in very far to see all of the images. I also attempted to resize the markers because the images were so large as icons, but it ruins the resolution of the picture. I think it helps being able to see multiple images.

*Please let me know if you need other forms of keys, etc. I was struggling understanding what keys you needed. The API key should be in the build and the debugger key is in the root folder. *
